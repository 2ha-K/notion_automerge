# Notion AutoMerge

**Notion AutoMerge** is a Python-based tool designed to automatically merge multiple Notion databases into a single
combined database. It intelligently maps fields, links source relations, synchronizes metadata (such as created/edited
times), and supports both one-way and conditional sync strategies.

This tool is ideal for users who manage scattered Notion databases and need a reliable, centralized view with custom
logic, field consistency, and relation integrity.
